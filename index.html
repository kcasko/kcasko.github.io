      <h2>Welcome to TaurusTech</h2>

      <p>This is my workshop on the web. TaurusTech exists to document what I am building, breaking, and learning as I move deeper into software engineering, systems administration, and cybersecurity.</p>

      <p>I grew up alongside the early internet. Dial up tones, CRT monitors, and software that demanded you understand it instead of just tapping buttons. That mindset stuck. I care about how systems work under the hood, not just how they look on the surface.</p>

      <p>Here you will find project write ups, home lab experiments, WGU coursework notes, and tools I am actively developing. Nothing here is theoretical. If it is listed, it has been built, tested, or broken at least once.</p>
