      <p>
        This page contains demonstration websites built to solve real problems for small local businesses.
        These are not templates or coursework. Each demo is designed around a specific business type,
        customer behavior, and conversion goal.

        <h3>Auto Repair Website Demo</h3>

        <p><em>Designed for a small, independent auto repair shop serving local customers.</em></p>

        <p>
          Many auto repair businesses rely entirely on Google listings or social media, which makes it
          difficult for customers to quickly find services, hours, and contact information when they
          actually need it.
        </p>

        <p>
          This demo showcases a fast, mobile-first website that prioritizes clarity, trust, and action.
          Key information is immediately visible, with clear calls to call, get directions, and understand
          available services.
        </p>
