            <h2>About Me :: Keith Casko</h2>

            <p>Hey there, welcome to TaurusTech! I'm Keith, the person behind this little corner of the web. If you're wondering about the retro theme, well, I grew up with the dial-up sounds and pixelated screens of the 80s and 90s, and it definitely left an impression!</p>

            <h3>From Baker to Builder</h3>
            <p>My path into technology hasn't been exactly linear. For over 20 years, my world revolved around baking – precision, process, and ensuring everything came together just right. While I enjoyed that craft, a long-held fascination with technology kept calling.</p>
            <p>I realized that many skills from baking – meticulous problem-solving, optimizing workflows, analytical thinking, and attention to detail – translate surprisingly well to the tech world. So, I decided to make the leap and pursue my passion for building and understanding systems.</p>

            <hr class="fancy-hr">

            <h3>Forging a New Path in Tech</h3>
            <p>Currently, I'm channeling that energy into my studies as a **Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering student at Western Governors University (WGU)**, aiming for graduation around 2029. It's an exciting journey covering everything from programming fundamentals to system administration.</p>

            <h4>My Tech Toolkit (Actively Expanding!)</h4>
            <p>I'm building skills across various domains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Getting comfortable with Python for scripting and automation, and learning Bash for system tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Systems & Networking:</strong> Working with Windows Server 2022 (including Active Directory!), Linux flavors like Ubuntu and Kali, and understanding network basics.</li>
                <li><strong>Tools & Concepts:</strong> Using VirtualBox and VMware for virtualization, Git for version control, VS Code, and diving into core software development concepts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Hands-On: The Home Lab Experience</h3>
            <p>Theory is one thing, but I learn best by doing. I run a home lab environment where I can experiment and break things (and hopefully fix them!):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Setting up and managing a full Windows Server 2022 domain with Active Directory, users, and group policies.</li>
                <li>Running a dual-boot system (Windows 11 / Ubuntu) and virtual machines (including Kali Linux for security practice).</li>
                <li>Writing Python scripts for practical tasks like file organization.</li>
                <li>Continuously troubleshooting network configurations and VM setups.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's my sandbox for applying what I learn and exploring new technologies.</p>

            <hr class="fancy-hr">

            <h3>Future Focus: Cybersecurity</h3>
            <p>While I'm currently focused on software engineering, my long-term interest lies strongly in **cybersecurity**. Understanding how systems are built is crucial for learning how to protect them. My experience with server administration, networking, and different operating systems (especially Kali Linux in the lab) is all building towards that goal. I'm planning on tackling certifications like CompTIA A+ and the Google IT Support cert to solidify my foundational knowledge.</p>

            <h3>Connect</h3>
            <p>I'm always learning and eager to connect with others in the tech community. Feel free to reach out!</p>
