      <h2>About Me :: Keith Casko</h2>

      <p>Hey there, welcome to TaurusTech! I'm Keith, the person behind this little corner of the web. If you're wondering about the retro theme, I grew up with the dial-up sounds and pixelated screens of the 80s and 90s, and they definitely left an impression.</p>

      <h3>From Baker to Builder</h3>
      <p>My path into technology hasn’t been exactly linear. For over 20 years, my world revolved around baking: precision, process, and making sure everything came together just right. While I enjoyed that craft, a long-held fascination with technology kept calling.</p>
      <p>I realized that many skills from baking, such as meticulous problem-solving, optimizing workflows, analytical thinking, and attention to detail, translate surprisingly well to the tech world. I decided to make the leap and pursue my passion for building and understanding systems.</p>

      <h3>Forging a New Path in Tech</h3>
      <p>Now I’m channeling that energy into my studies as a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering student at Western Governors University (WGU)</strong>, aiming for graduation around 2029. It’s been an exciting journey covering everything from programming fundamentals to system administration.</p>

      <h4>My Tech Toolkit (Actively Expanding)</h4>
      <p>I’m building skills across several domains:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Learning Python for scripting and automation, and Bash for system tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Systems & Networking:</strong> Working with Windows Server 2022 (including Active Directory setup), Linux distributions like Ubuntu and Kali, and gaining a stronger understanding of network fundamentals.</li>
        <li><strong>Tools & Concepts:</strong> Using VirtualBox and VMware for virtualization, Git for version control, VS Code for development, and applying software engineering principles to real-world projects.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Hands-On: The Home Lab Experience</h3>
      <p>Theory is one thing, but I learn best by doing. I run a home lab environment where I can experiment, test, and troubleshoot:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Setting up and managing a full Windows Server 2022 domain with Active Directory, users, and group policies.</li>
        <li>Running a dual-boot setup (Windows 11 and Ubuntu) with virtual machines for testing and security practice.</li>
        <li>Writing Python scripts for practical automation and file management.</li>
        <li>Constantly improving network configurations and refining system setups through hands-on troubleshooting.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s my sandbox for applying what I learn and exploring new technologies.</p>

      <h3>Future Focus: Cybersecurity</h3>
      <p>While I’m currently focused on software engineering, my long-term goal leans strongly toward <strong>cybersecurity</strong>. Understanding how systems are built is essential for learning how to protect them. My experience with server administration, networking, and different operating systems, especially Kali Linux in the lab, is all building toward that goal. I plan to pursue certifications like CompTIA A+ and Google IT Support to strengthen my foundational knowledge.</p>
