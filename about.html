      <h2>About Me :: Keith Casko</h2>

      <p>
        Welcome to TaurusTech. This is my workshop on the web.
      </p>

      <p>
        I grew up in the era of dial-up modems, CRT monitors, and software that
        came with manuals thicker than a phone book. Those early years left a
        permanent mark. I gravitate toward systems that make sense, tools that
        do real work, and technology you can understand instead of blindly
        clicking through.
      </p>

      <h3>From Baker to Builder</h3>

      <p>
        For over twenty years, I worked in professional baking. That world runs
        on precision, timing, repetition, and problem solving under pressure.
        When one variable is off, everything downstream breaks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, it became clear that the skills I relied on every day were
        already technical. Optimizing workflows, diagnosing failures, and
        producing consistent results from complex systems. I was thinking like
        an engineer long before I changed the tools.
      </p>

      <h3>Building Systems, Not Just Code</h3>

      <p>
        I am pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering at
        Western Governors University</strong>. My focus goes beyond writing code.
        I care about how systems fit together from the hardware layer up through
        the operating system, networking, and application stack.
      </p>

      <p>
        I learn by breaking things, fixing them, and rebuilding them better.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Work With</h3>

      <p>
        My work spans scripting, automation, and systems administration.
        That includes Python and Bash for automation, Windows Server environments
        with Active Directory and Group Policy, Linux systems such as Ubuntu and
        Kali, virtualization with VMware and VirtualBox, and modern development
        tooling like Git and VS Code.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site documents that work. The wins, the failures, and everything in
        between.
      </p>

      <h3>The Home Lab</h3>

      <p>
        Most of my learning happens in a home lab where theory meets reality.
        I build and manage Windows Server domains from scratch, maintain
        virtualized and dual-boot environments, and write scripts to automate
        real problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is my proving ground for troubleshooting, experimentation, and deep
        system understanding.
      </p>

      <h3>Long-Term Direction</h3>

      <p>
        While software engineering is my academic path, my long-term direction
        is cybersecurity. You cannot defend systems you do not understand.
        Everything I build now lays the groundwork for that path, from operating
        systems and networking to security-focused tooling.
      </p>

      <p>
        TaurusTech exists to document that journey and to build useful things
        along the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are into systems, learning by doing, and understanding how things
        actually work under the hood, you are in the right place.
