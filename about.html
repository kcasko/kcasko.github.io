      <h2>About Me :: Keith Casko</h2>

      <p>Welcome to TaurusTech. This is my workshop on the web.</p>

      <p>I grew up in the era of dial up modems, CRT monitors, and software that came with manuals thicker than a phone book. Those early years left a permanent mark. I like systems that make sense, tools that do real work, and technology you can actually understand instead of just clicking through.</p>

      <h3>From Baker to Builder</h3>

      <p>For over twenty years, I worked in professional baking. That world runs on precision, timing, repetition, and problem solving under pressure. If one variable is off, everything downstream breaks.</p>

      <p>Over time, I realized that the skills I relied on every day were already technical. Optimizing workflows, fixing broken processes, and producing consistent results from complex systems. Eventually it became obvious that I was thinking like an engineer. I just needed to change the tools.</p>

      <h3>Building Systems, Not Just Code</h3>

      <p>I am currently pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering at Western Governors University</strong>, with a target graduation around 2029. My focus is not just writing code, but understanding how systems fit together from the hardware up through the operating system, network, and application layer.</p>

      <p>I learn by breaking things, fixing them, and rebuilding them better.</p>

      <h3>What I Work With</h3>

      <p>My current focus includes Python for scripting and automation, Bash for system tasks, and hands on systems administration. I actively work with Windows Server 2022 including Active Directory and Group Policy, Linux environments like Ubuntu and Kali, virtualization using VirtualBox and VMware, and modern development tools such as Git and VS Code.</p>

      <p>This site documents that work. The wins, the failures, and everything in between.</p>

      <h3>The Home Lab</h3>

      <p>Most of my learning happens in a home lab where theory meets reality. I run a Windows Server domain from scratch, manage users and policies, maintain dual boot and virtualized environments, and write scripts to automate real problems.</p>

      <p>It is my proving ground for troubleshooting, experimentation, and deep system understanding.</p>

      <h3>Long Term Direction</h3>

      <p>While software engineering is my current academic path, my long term focus is cybersecurity. You cannot defend systems you do not understand. Everything I am building now lays the groundwork for that direction, from operating systems to networking to security focused tooling.</p>

      <p>TaurusTech exists to document that journey and to build useful things along the way.</p>

      <p>If you are into systems, learning by doing, and understanding how things actually work under the hood, you are in the right place.</p>
