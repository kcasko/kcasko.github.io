      <h2>SanDisk Ultra Flair 128GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive</h2>
      <p>
        Small flash drives are easy to lose, but you still need one that actually holds a decent amount of data.
        This one hits the sweet spot.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it for file transfers, backups, and moving stuff between machines.
        Simple, fast enough, and hasn’t given me any problems.
      </p>

      <h2>15ft Indoor Extension Cord (16/3, Flat Black)</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes the outlet just isn’t where you need it.
        This fixes that without being stiff, bulky, or sketchy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it for home office and general setup flexibility.
        It’s durable, long enough to matter, and doesn’t feel cheap.
      </p>

      <h2>Adjustable Desk Phone Stand</h2>
      <p>
        Propping your phone against random objects gets old fast.
        This just holds it at a usable angle without sliding around.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it on my desk for calls, videos, and notifications.

      <h2>Adjustable Aluminum Tablet Stand</h2>
      <p>
        Holding a tablet for long periods gets uncomfortable fast.
        This keeps it stable at a good viewing angle on a desk.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it for tablets and larger devices when I want hands-free viewing.
        The price moves a bit, but it’s usually under $25 and solid when it is.

      <h2>Microfiber Cleaning Cloths (18-Pack)</h2>
      <p>
        Screens, glasses, and lenses get dirty constantly.
        Using paper towels or random fabric just makes it worse.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use these for glasses, phones, tablets, and camera lenses.
        Cheap, effective, and you don’t worry about ruining one.

      <h2>USB to 3.5mm Audio Adapter Cable</h2>
      <p>
        When a headphone jack stops working or doesn’t exist at all, audio gets annoying fast.
        This cable fixes that by handling audio over USB.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it for headphones and speakers on PCs and consoles.
        Cheap, simple, and it just works.

      <h2>Clipboard with Storage Compartment</h2>
      <p>
        Loose papers, notes, and small items get lost fast.
        This keeps everything together while still giving you a solid writing surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it for notes, documents, and small items that need a temporary home.
        Cheap, simple, and more useful than a basic clipboard.

      <h2>80W Digital Soldering Iron Kit</h2>
      <p>
        This isn’t something everyone needs, but it’s cheap enough to be worth having if you do basic electronic repairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve used this for small fixes and DIY repairs.
        It heats up quickly, comes with the basics, and does the job without being complicated.

      <h2>USB-C to USB-A Adapter (2-Pack)</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of older accessories still use USB-A, while newer devices are all USB-C.
        These adapters make them work together without replacing everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use these for flash drives, keyboards, mice, and random USB accessories.
        Cheap, simple, and handy to keep around.

      <h2>Clamp-On LED Desk Lamp</h2>
      <p>
        Bad lighting makes desk work harder than it needs to be.
        This clamps onto a desk or headboard and puts light exactly where you want it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it for desk work and reading.
        The adjustable brightness and color modes make it easy on the eyes without taking up desk space.
