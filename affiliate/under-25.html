      <h2>INIU USB-C to USB-C Cable (240W, 6.6ft)</h2>
      <p>
        Most USB-C cables are slow or inconsistent. This one isn’t.
        It charges noticeably faster and hasn’t given me a single issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it for phones and laptops, and it actually delivers full-speed charging instead of pretending to.

      <h2>140-in-1 Precision Screwdriver Repair Kit</h2>
      <p>
        Electronics use annoying tiny screws, and the wrong tool will strip them instantly.
        This kit solves that problem in one shot.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve used it for laptops, phones, controllers, and random tech repairs.
        For the price, it’s hard to beat.

      <h2>Flat Plug Surge Protector Power Strip (8 Outlets + USB)</h2>
      <p>
        Most power strips are cramped and useless once you plug in anything bulky.
        This one actually leaves enough space for big plugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve bought this same power strip three times for different rooms.
        The spacing, flat plug, and built-in USB ports make it easy to justify every time.

      <h2>Acodot 9-in-1 USB-C Hub</h2>
      <p>
        Modern laptops keep removing ports. This hub adds them back.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it for HDMI, USB devices, SD cards, and charging at the same time.
        For under $25, it’s hard to beat how much it replaces.

      <h2>SABRENT SATA to USB Adapter Cable</h2>
      <p>
        If you’ve ever pulled a hard drive or SSD out of an old laptop, you know how annoying it is to access the data.
        This cable makes it plug-and-play.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it to read old drives, recover files, or quickly check if a drive still works.
        Cheap, simple, and surprisingly useful.
