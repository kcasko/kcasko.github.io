      <h2>KROSER Laptop Briefcase (Up to 17.3”)</h2>
      <p>
        Carrying a laptop in a flimsy bag is a good way to break expensive gear.
        This one is built to actually protect it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it for travel and daily carry.
        It has enough space for a large laptop and accessories without feeling cheap or overstuffed.

      <h2>Samsung EVO Select 512GB microSD Card</h2>
      <p>
        Cheap microSD cards are fine until they corrupt or slow everything down.
        This one is about capacity and reliability.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it for high-capacity storage where speed and stability actually matter.
        It’s not the cheapest option, but it’s one I trust with real data.

      <h2>LEVO G2 Deluxe Rolling Laptop Stand</h2>
      <p>
        Working from a couch or bed usually means awkward angles and bad posture.
        This solves that by bringing the desk to you instead of forcing your body to adapt.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it as a mobile workstation for longer sessions.
        It’s stable, adjustable, and makes working comfortably possible in places a normal desk doesn’t.

      <h2>CanaKit Raspberry Pi 5 Starter Kit PRO (8GB, 128GB)</h2>
      <p>
        This isn’t a bare-bones Raspberry Pi setup.
        It’s a complete, ready-to-use mini computer for projects, home labs, and always-on tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it for tinkering and lightweight server-style work without dedicating a full desktop.
        It costs more than basic kits, but it saves time and frustration by just working.

      <h2>Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless Noise-Cancelling Headphones</h2>
      <p>
        Noise is one of the fastest ways to lose focus.
        These block it out without being uncomfortable or sounding artificial.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use them for long work sessions, calls, and general listening.
        The battery life is excellent, the noise cancellation is effective, and they stay comfortable for hours.

      <h2>Big & Tall High-Back Office Chair (400lb Capacity)</h2>
      <p>
        Cheap office chairs fail fast and punish your back even faster.
        This one is built for support, stability, and long sitting sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it for extended desk time.
        The wide seat and lumbar support make a real difference if you need something sturdier than standard chairs.

      <h2>14” Portable Laptop Screen Extender (Triple Display)</h2>
      <p>
        One laptop screen is a bottleneck.
        This adds extra displays without needing a permanent desk setup.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it when I need more screen space for multitasking without dragging around external monitors.
        It’s especially useful for writing, coding, and research.
      </p>

      <h2>Texas Instruments TI-84 Plus CE Graphing Calculator</h2>
      <p>
        This is the calculator most schools and exams are built around.
        That alone makes it worth paying for.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it because it’s accepted everywhere, reliable, and does exactly what coursework expects.
        It’s expensive, but it avoids compatibility problems and lasts for years.

      <h2>WD Elements Portable External Hard Drive</h2>
      <p>
        Running out of storage is inevitable if you keep files long enough.
        This gives you a lot of space without turning into a desk brick.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it for backups and large files.
        It’s plug-and-play, reliable, and holds enough data that I don’t have to constantly think about storage.
